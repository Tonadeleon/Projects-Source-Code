An unpublished, but pretty cool example of a parameterized 2D plot in Python. 

Equations such as this can be used in business modeling for forecasting, expectations, budgeting and more; for that purpose you'd estimate a business model equation instead of a the equation that I used to form this star. Then you can use tools such as calculus, multivariable calculus, stochastic calculus, machine learning to work off of that equation and get your estimates.
