<h2 style="text-align: center;">Repo Summary</h2>

I finally made some time to gather most of my projects in a single repo. Most of them are still to be re-organized and updated to their newest versions. Some are also yet to be hosted live in my portfolio.

To see my most updated projects please visit: https://tonadeleon.netlify.app/

In these repo I'll be including my weekly work by date folders and then project name folders (i.e 2024/Nov/"Holt-Winters Forecasting")
